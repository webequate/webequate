# Allen Johnson
## Front End Software Engineer / Full Stack Web Developer
I'm Allen Johnson. I live in Denver, Colorado.
<br><br>
I am a veteran front end software engineer with considerable full stack development experience. I am most comfortable with **JavaScript / TypeScript**, **React**, **HTML**, and **CSS** in various environments, including **Node.js**, **PHP**, **Java**, and **Ruby on Rails**.
<br><br>
I recently spent a year contracting with a team at **Etsy** to facilitate server-side rendering of **React** component islands, able to communicate through a shared **Redux** store. This helped product engineers to provide enhanced user experiences for Etsy customers, while still maintaining fast page load times, through on-demand hydration of static content with interactive features.
<br><br>
In the months since Etsy, I have focused mostly on my own business, **WebEquate**. I have been rebuilding websites previously built with **PHP** and **MySQL**, instead using **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB**, and deploy to Vercel, to modernize my development workflow, streamline site updates, and improve site performance.
<br><br>
Now I am seeking a new opportunity as a **Front End Software Engineer** or **Full Stack Software Engineer**, with a strong preference for fully remote roles.
<br><br>
I also enjoy travel, hiking, photography, electronic music, and foreign languages.
<br><br>
**Note:**  Most of my projects have been proprietary, are stored elsewhere, or cannot be made public. But, I am working gradually on being able to provide more public respositories here.
