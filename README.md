# Allen Johnson
## Full Stack Web Developer & Front End Software Engineer
I'm Allen Johnson.
<br><br>
I am a veteran full stack developer and front end engineer based in Denver, Colorado. I am most comfortable with **JavaScript / TypeScript**, **React**, **HTML**, and **CSS** in various environments, including **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **PHP**, **Java**, and **Ruby on Rails**.
<br><br>
I recently spent a year contracting with a team at **Etsy** to facilitate server-side rendering of **React** component islands, able to communicate using a shared **Redux** store. This helped product engineers to provide enhanced user experiences for Etsy customers, while still maintaining fast page load times, through on-demand hydration of static content with interactive features.
<br><br>
In the time since Etsy, I have focused mostly on my own business, **WebEquate**. I have built new websites and re-built my existing portfolio of websites using **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **MongoDB**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vercel**, to modernize my development workflow, streamline site updates, and improve site performance.
<br><br>
I am currently seeking a new opportunity to contribute to a dynamic and collaborative team or to an interesting project or initiative, with a preference for mostly remote work.
<br><br>
I also enjoy travel, hiking, photography, electronic music, generative AI, and foreign languages.
