# Allen Johnson
I am a full stack software engineer based in Denver, Colorado.
<br>
I am actively looking for a new opportunity as a remote Front End Software Engineer or Full Stack Software Engineer!
<br>
I have 20+ years of experience working in many different tech stacks. I am currently most familiar with JavaScript / TypeScript, React / Redux / Next.js, and HTML / CSS in various environments, including Node.js, PHP, and Java. I have worked in a wide range of industries, and in companies and teams of various sizes.
<br>
I recently spent a year contracting with a team at Etsy which helped product engineers to use more modern front end development practices. By providing server-side rendering of React component islands, able to communicate through a shared Redux store, we facilitated the building of enhanced user experiences for Etsy customers, while still maintaining fast page load times, made possible by on-demand hydration of static content with interactive features.
<br>
In the months since Etsy, I have focused mostly on my own business, WebEquate. I have been rebuilding websites previously built with PHP and MySQL, instead using Next.js, React, TypeScript, MongoDB, and TailwindCSS, to modernize web development workflow, streamline site updates, and enhance site speed.
<br>
Now I am seeking a new full-time or part-time role, with a strong preference for fully remote. I am open to contract or employee roles.
